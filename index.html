                <!-- Project 1: VANET -->
                <div class="project">
                    <h3>VANET (2022)</h3>
                    <p>Designed and implemented a sophisticated <strong>Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET)</strong> system, finely tuned to optimize <strong>Emergency Medical Services (EMS)</strong> with a primary focus on ambulance assistance. The project's core objective is to elevate emergency vehicle communication by seamlessly transmitting automatic alerts enriched with precise <strong>Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates</strong> and optimal route details in real-time.</p>
                    
                    <p>In routine scenarios, the system employs <strong>Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)</strong> and <strong>Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)</strong> communication utilizing <strong>Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC)</strong> and <strong>Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X)</strong> technologies. Through <strong>GeoNetworking protocols</strong>, <em>Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM)</em> are disseminated to nearby vehicles, fostering preemptive awareness and ensuring proactive hazard mitigation for a safer driving environment.</p>
                    
                    <p>During high-traffic situations, the system dynamically applies sophisticated <strong>Intelligent Transportation System (ITS)</strong> techniques such as <em>Dynamic Route Guidance (DRG)</em> and <em>Traffic Adaptive Routing (TAR)</em>, leveraging advanced <strong>Traffic Flow Optimization (TFO)</strong> algorithms. These algorithms, informed by real-time traffic data obtained through simulation using <strong>OpenModelica</strong> for microsimulation and <strong>SUMO</strong> for macroscopic traffic flow analysis, enable dynamic rerouting of emergency vehicles to circumvent congestion hotspots and minimize response time.</p>
                    
                    <p>The implementation of this system was orchestrated through the integration of cutting-edge open-source simulation platforms, including <strong>OMNET++</strong> for network modeling and simulation, and <strong>SUMO</strong> for traffic simulation and analysis. By harnessing the power of these advanced tools and protocols, the project not only achieved robust functionality but also ensured scalability, interoperability, and adaptability for deployment in real-world scenarios.</p>

                <!-- Project 2: Pygame -->
                <div class="project">
                    <h3>Pygame (2020)</h3>
                    <p>Explored the fundamentals of <strong>Python programming</strong> and delved into game development using the <strong>Pygame</strong> library. This project focused on creating interactive gaming experiences reminiscent of classic arcade-style games like <strong>Snake</strong> and <strong>Ping-Pong</strong>. Through <strong>Pygame</strong>, essential concepts such as <strong>game loops</strong>, <strong>event handling</strong>, <strong>sprite animation</strong>, and <strong>collision detection</strong> were implemented to craft engaging gameplay mechanics. <strong>Game loops</strong> ensured smooth gameplay, while <strong>event handling</strong> captured user input for seamless interaction. <strong>Sprite animation</strong> brought game elements to life with fluid movements and dynamic transformations using <strong>sprite sheets</strong>. Robust <strong>collision detection algorithms</strong> enhanced realism, accurately detecting and resolving interactions between objects. By leveraging <strong>Pygame's</strong> capabilities, this project not only provided hands-on experience in <strong>Python programming</strong> but also instilled a deeper understanding of game development principles. It served as a springboard for creating captivating gaming experiences, laying a solid foundation for future exploration and innovation in the realm of game development.</p>
